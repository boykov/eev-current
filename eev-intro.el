The standard way to evaluate Lisp: `C-x C-e'
============================================
The most important idea in Emacs is that Lisp code can appear
anywhere, and you can evaluate a Lisp expression (a \"sexp\") by
placing the cursor (the \"point\") just after it and typing `C-x
C-e'; the result is then displayed in the echo area. Try it in
the line below, with the point in the three different indicated
positions - you should get different results.

  (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))
            ^       ^^
            |       | \\
            6      20  26



The end of line and `M-e'
=========================
A common operation is to move the point to the end of the current
line, then run `C-x C-e'. That can be done with `C-e C-x C-e',
but eev-mode implements a shorthand for it: `M-e'. Try it here:

  (+ (* 2 3)
     (* 4 5)
     )

`M-e' accepts several different numeric prefixes that alter its
behavior. We are only interested in one of them now - `M-0 M-e'
highlights the sexp for a fraction of a second insted of
executing it. Try it above.

In some rare occasions we might want to run something like `M-e'
but without moving to the end of the line first. Eev-mode
implements a key binding for that: `M-E' (meta-shift-e). As an
exercise, Try to use `M-0 M-E' at several positions below, to
hightlight the subsexps `(* 2 3)', `(* 4 5)', and `4'.

  (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))




What to execute, and in what order
==================================
Note that the order of evaluation may be important:

  (setq a 5)
  (setq a 6)
  (* a a)

By executing `(setq a 5)' and then `(* a a)' above we get 25,
by executing `(setq a 6)' and then `(* a a)' we get 36 - the
current value of `a' is the one of the last `setq' executed.

An exercise: edit the three sexps above to introduce a
`(setq a 22)', then use that sexp and the `(* a a)' to calculate
the square of 22.

MORAL: Elisp code can appear anywhere in any Emacs buffer, but it
is _passive by default_. It only gets executed if we move the
point to the right positions and type `C-x C-e', `M-e', or
similar keys. Sexps can be executed any number of times, in any
order, and can be edited and modified.




Elisp hyperlinks
================
Some Emacs functions can be used as hyperlinks. When sexps like

  (find-file \"/tmp/\")
  (info \"(emacs)Lisp Eval\")
  (man \"cat\")

are executed they \"open a new page\" - actually, they create a
new buffer, or reuse it if it already exists - and it is usually
possible to \"go back\" by killing the new buffer. However for
some functions, like `man', which by default open a manpage in
another window, \"going back\" would mean something different.

Eev defines several functions to let us use sexps as hyperlinks.
The main conventions on these functions are:

  1) their names start with \"find-\",

  2) calls to them can be \"refined\" with a pos-spec (this will
     be discussed below),

  3) they open the new buffer in the current window (to make it
     easier to \"go back\" after following them - see the next
     section),

  4) they don't display much output in the echo area,

  5) when they create temporary buffers with lots of sexps then:

     a) the first sexp in that buffer is one that can regenerate
        that buffer when executed,

     b) all the sexps are prefixed with the string stored in the
        variable `ee-hyperlink-prefix', to let these sexps be
        pasted into scripts as comments (see below).



Going back
==========
Web browsers let you follow a hyperlink and then \"go back\".
There are different ways of going back - if you opened the new
page on a new window or tab, then going back means deleting the
new window or tab (or just switching to the old window/tab); if
you opened the new page on the same window/tab, then you need to
use the \"back\" button.

Eev-mode defines two keys for \"going back\": `M-k', that kills
the current buffer, and `M-K', that just hides it (\"buries\" it
in the bottom of the list of all buffers). Try following the link
below by <M-e>, then deleting its buffer with `M-k' to go back:

  (find-enode \"Shell\")

In some cases we know that we may want to go \"forward\" again
after going back, and we may not want to delete the target buffer
- for example, because it would take a while to rebuild it again,
or because we would lose the position of the point there. Most
hyperlink functions in eev are able to reuse a buffer that
\"looks like\" the desired target buffer; the test for
lookalikeness is based on the name of the buffer only. Try to
follow the links below with `M-e', then come back to this buffer
with `M-k', then follow them again. Then try the same thing with
`M-K' instead of `M-k', to see the difference.

  (find-man \"1 bash\")
  (find-sh \"sleep 1; echo 'The output of a shell command:'; date\")



Refining hyperlinks
===================
Most hyperlinks functions defined by eev can be \"refined\" by
the addition of extra arguments. These extra arguments are called
a \"pos-spec\" (or a \"pos-spec-list\") and they specify a
position in the target buffer. The first argument means a certain
line number, when it is a number, or the first occurrence of a
certain string, when it is a string. Try:

  (find-enode \"Command Index\")
  (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"eval-last-sexp\")

Further arguments mean either \"move down n lines\" or \"search
for the next occurrence of a string\", depending on whether they
are numbers or strings. Try:

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" \"9\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" 2)



Producing and refining hyperlinks
=================================
If you are on an Info page, typing `M-h M-i' will create a
temporary buffer containing a header - which we will discuss
later - and several (possibly equivalent) links to that info
page. Something like this:
   ________________________________________________________
  |;; (find-einfo-links)                                   |
  |                                                        |
  |;; (info \"(emacs)Misc Buffer\")                          |
  |;; (find-node \"(emacs)Misc Buffer\")                     |
  |;; (find-enode \"Misc Buffer\")                           |
  |                                                        |
  |                                                        |
  |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental)---|
  |________________________________________________________|

These links are meant to be cut & pasted - possibly after
refining them to make them more precise. Let's look first at the
two key sequences that make refining much easier. Remember that
`M-w' (`kill-ring-save') is roughly correspondent to what is
called \"copy\" is most modern interfaces, and `C-y' (`yank') is
roughly correspondent to \"paste\". Both `M-w' and `C-y' operate
on Emacs's \"kill ring\", and to make our examples trivial to
follow we will first put a string on the kill ring:

  (kill-new \"C-y\")
  (car kill-ring)

Now let's see how refine hyperlinks quickly. `M-h M-2' duplicates
the current line; we will use that to refine a copy of a working
hyperlink, instead of working directly on the original, and
risking breaking it. And `M-h M-y' refines the hyperlink on the
current line by adding a string - the top element in the kill
ring - to its sexp. Try this below; you should be able to convert

  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\")

into

  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\" \"C-y\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\" \"C-y\")

quite easily, as in the key sequence `M-h M-2 M-h M-y' you can
leave the meta key pressed all the time.

Now try a more serious exercise: follow the `(find-enode ...)'
hyperlink below, copy a word or two from its contents to the kill
ring with `M-w', then generate the temporary buffer with
hyperlinks to that Info page with `M-h M-i', then duplicate one
of its hyperlinks with `M-h M-2', refine it with `M-h M-y', and
copy the result to this sandbox with `M-w' (or `C-w') and `C-y'.
As this is a long sequence of instructions, it is better to run
`C-x 1 C-x 2' or `C-x 1 C-x 3' before following the hyperlink, to
keep the instructions visible.

  (find-enode \"Command Index\")




What else?
==========
Eev-mode defines several other key sequences similar to `M-h
M-i'. You can get the full list here:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-h f\")

Try also this:

  (find-efunction-links 'eev-mode)

The motivation for eepitch: taking notes and redoing
====================================================
Suppose that we have to do some reasonably complex task using a
shell, and that we want to take notes of what we do because we
might have to do something similar later.

The two usual ways to interact with a shell are:

  1) through a _script_, that is, by preparing in advance all
     commands to be executed, putting them in a script file, and
     then running that file,

  2) _interactively_, by typing the commands one by one on a
     shell prompt.

Suppose that we have to discover which commands to run as we go;
that rules out preparing a script beforehand, so we need to use
the shell interactively. After issuing the right commands, the
two usual ways to retrieve what we did are:

  a) through the _shell history_, which records the last commands
     that the shell received,

  b) by looking at the full _transcript_ of our interaction with
     the shell.

The way (a) gets a list of commands, without comments, that can
be then saved into a text editor; the way (b) may require some
tricky editing to isolate the commands from their outputs.

Eepitch.el implements a simple alternative way of interacting
with shells (and other shell-like programs) while keeping notes.
It has only one essential key binding, <F8>, which is better
explained through the executable example in the next section, and
two unessential features, <M-T> and \"\", which will be
explained later.



The main key: <F8>
==================
Emacs can run a shell in a buffer, and it can split its frame
into windows, like this:
   ___________________
  |         |         |
  |   our   |    a    |
  |  notes  |  shell  |
  |         |  buffer |
  |_________|_________|

The usual way to use a shell buffer is to move the cursor there
and type commands into its prompt; the eepitch-y way is to leave
the cursor at the \"notes\" buffer, write the commands for the
shell there, and send these commands to the shell with <F8>.

Here's what <F8> does:

  When we type <F8> on a line that starts with a red
  star (\"\"), it executes the rest of the line as Lisp, and
  moves down; when we type <F8> on a line that does not start
  with a \"\", it makes sure that the \"target buffer\" is being
  displayed (the \"target\" is usually the buffer called
  \"*shell*\"), it \"send\"s the current line to the target
  buffer, and moves down.

  \"Sending the current line to the target buffer\" means copying
  the contents of the current line to the target - as if the user
  had typed that line there by hand -, then \"typing\" a <RET> at
  the target buffet.

Please try that in the example after this paragraph, by typing
<F8> six times starting at the first line that says
\" (eepitch-shell)\". The three red star lines at the top will
create a target buffer, destroy it, and create it again; the
other three lines will send commands to the target shell.

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo \"We are at: $PWD\"
cd /tmp/
echo \"We changed to: $(pwd)\"




Other targets
=============
Just like `(eepitch-shell)' creates a shell buffer and sets the
eepitch target to it, `(eepitch-python)' creates a buffer with a
Python interpreter and uses it as the eepitch target. Try:

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
def square (x):
    return x*x

print(square(5))

We can use several targets at the time, alternating between them.
For example:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())




More on eepitch-kill
====================
Note that `(eepitch-kill)' kills the _current_ target, that may
or may not be a shell buffer, a Python interaction buffer, etc...
That explains the first line in blocks like:

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)

and:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

by running the first `(eepitch-python)' we can be sure that the
following `(eepitch-kill)' will kill the Python buffer, not the
shell buffer! And the last `(eepitch-python)' in the block of
three lines will then create a new Python interaction buffer,
erasing all definitions done in previous sessions.




Creating eepitch blocks: <M-T>
==============================
Write just \"shell\" or \"python\" in a line, then type
<M-T> (i.e., meta-shift-t) there. The line will be turned into
three - an \" (eepitch-xxx)\", an \" (eepitch-kill)\", and an
\" (eepitch-xxx)\". We call these blocks of three lines
\"eepitch blocks\". Try this below, converting the \"shell\" into
an eepitch block for starting a shell.

shell
pwd
cd /tmp/
pwd




Red stars
=========
Eepitch.el sets the glyph for the char 15 to a red star in the
standard display table. In layman's terms: eepitch.el tells Emacs
that the character 15 should be displayed as a red star. The
character 15 corresponds to control-O, whose default
representation on screen would be \"^O\".. You can enter a
literal ^O in a buffer by typing C-q C-o.

Eepitch and eev
===============
Eepitch has two basic keys - <F8> and <M-T> - and <M-T> is a
particular case of something much more general. Eev-mode defines
several `wrapping functions', all of which follow these conventions:

  1) they are bound to meta-shift-letter keys (M-T, M-F, M-M, ...),
  2) they transform the current line and then move down,
  3) they produce Lisp code meant to be executed with `M-e' or `F8',
  4) they are listed at:
       (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-F\")
  5) their keybindings are only available when eev-mode is turned on
     (except for <M-T>).

To understand how they work, please follow the instructions below and
try them here. Note that this buffer is a sandbox, and it can be
recreated by executing the sexp \"(find-wrap-intro)\" at the top.


<M-T>: produce an eepitch block
===============================
If you type <M-T> on a line containing just the word \"shell\" you get
three lines, like this:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

We call a block of three lines like this an \"eepitch block\", and
eepitch blocks can be used to set up interactions with external
programs. Try typing <M-T> on the lines that say \"shell\" and \"python\"
below, and use them to send some lines to bash and to a python
interpreter (with <F8>):

bash
export PS1='$PWD% '
cd /tmp/
function ee () { set -v; . /tmp/ee.sh; set +v; }
rm -v /tmp/ee.sh
cat > /tmp/ee.sh <<'%%%'
  echo Hello
  cd /etc/
%%%
cat   /tmp/ee.sh
bash  /tmp/ee.sh
ee

python
square = lambda x: x*x
square(5)



<M-S>: hyperlink to the output of a shell command
=================================================
If you type <M-F> on a line containing a shell command you get a
hyperlink that starts with `find-sh', and that when followed opens a
temporary buffer with the output of that shell command, like these:

  # (find-sh \"find --help\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d -maxdepth 1 | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d -maxdepth 2 | sort\")

Try it here:

dict smop
dict 'minor detail'
