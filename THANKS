Eev wouldn't have been possible - or would have been much worse, or
whatever - without the help of:

  David Allouche
  David Hansen
  David O'Toole
  Diogo Leal
  Georg Greve
  Gerd Moellmann
  Igor Morgado
  Leslie Watter
  Marcos Nicolaiewsky
  Richard Stallman
  bpalmer
  dvalois
  jahnke
  kov
  rubikitch
  sachac

and of the people at the #emacs IRC channel at freenode.
This list is grossly incomplete, but hey, this is a pre-release!
