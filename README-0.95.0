This is the `README-0.95.0' file of GNU eev.
This file is in the Public Domain.
eev-0.95.0 was released some time ago. eev-current is better.
See <http://angg.twu.net/README.html>,
    <http://angg.twu.net/INSTALL.html>,
and <http://angg.twu.net/INSTALL-0.95.0>.

The contents of the original README-0.95.0 file were:

--snip--snip--snip--

2004dec31, 23:34 (timezone: BRST)

Great news! The current version of eev-current has just become
eev-0.95.0! The tarball will be kept at:

  <http://angg.twu.net/eev-0.95.0.tar.gz>

I didn't change the occurrences of `eev-current' in the files to
`eev-0.95.0', so you'll have to believe what this file says. The file
VERSION in this directory is created automatically by "make", and if
it says that the time in the BRST timezone was between 23:30 and 23:59
when the file was created then, trust me, you're looking at version
0.95.0.

Happy new year! The current versions of the individual files are
accessible at:

  <http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/>

A good point to start is here:
