This is the `tmp/README' file of GNU eev.
This directory is where eev saves most of its temporary scripts.
If other people have access to your home directory then you should
consider making this directory accessible only by you.

The files with names starting with "ee" are temporary files created by eev.
The files with names starting with "tmp" are usually wrappers. See tmp.tex.
