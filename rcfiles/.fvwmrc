# The easiest way to install this - i.e., to make fvwm e-scriptable -
# is to add these commands (there are only three commands in this
# file) to one of you fvwm initialization files. This is not done
# automatically by "make preinstall"/"make install"; you'll have to do
# it by hand.

# (find-man "1 fvwm" "\nCONFIGURATION FILES\n")
# (find-fline "~/.fvwm/")

# Define a function `ee' that executes the temporary fvwm script.
# Note that the temporary fvwm script is a file in ~/.fvwm/ , not in 
# ~/eev-current/tmp/ .

# Listen to commands from the outside.
# Without this running `FvwmCommand' on a shell won't work.
# `find-fvwm0' works by saving the fwvm commands in the temporary
# fvwm script file and running "FvwmCommand ee" on a shell.
