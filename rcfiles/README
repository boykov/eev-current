This is the `rcfiles/README' file of GNU eev.

This directory contains scripts to create patched versions of rcfiles
(change, change.awk), scripts that will be "source"d by the patched
rcfiles (.bashrc, .bashrc-psne, .zshrc, .zshrc-pnse, .tclshrc), a few
other rcfile fragments that are not installed by default (.fvwmrc,
.pythonrc.py, .vimrc), and scripts that implement, huh, "direct
communication thorugh channels" in some specific languages
(channel.py, channel.tcl).
