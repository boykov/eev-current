This is the `rcfiles/tmp/README' file of GNU eev.

This directory is used by the installation process of eev to store
backups of rcfiles (a copy of ~/.bashrc becomes .bashrc.old here, for
example), to store the patched rcfiles (~/.bashrc -> .bashrc.new, etc)
and to store the shell scripts that do the actual installation and
uninstallation of these patched files (do_install.sh and
do_uninstall.sh).
