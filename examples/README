This is the file 'examples/README' of GNU eev.

This directory contains some example e-scripts and some auxiliary
programs used by these e-scripts. They are not very tidy. Sorry.

Note: I have the feeling that these files should be released under a
more permissive license: something like what happens (maybe not in the
U.S., but certainly in all the more reasonable parts of the world)
with graffittis; if some sentences get written in a wall in a very
visible place then no one afterwards can claim that that text was his
private work and try to collect copyright fees on that, or to restrict
people's rights of quoting and modifying that text. What is written on
the walls becomes "non-ownable".

The problem is: which licensing scheme would be closer to that? The
GPL is good enough - it has some funny twists, but it needs those in
order to defend us from insane laws - but maybe something else would
be a bit more adequate in this case. That needs to be discussed.
